# Geldium-Delinquency-Prediction-
A machine learning project to predict credit card payment delinquency using customer behavior data. Built for the Geldium Collections team as part of the Tata iQ Forage simulation. Includes EDA, SMOTE, PCA, and model evaluation (Random Forest, XGBoost).
#  Credit Card Delinquency Prediction â€“ Geldium (Tata iQ)

This project predicts whether a customer is likely to become delinquent on their credit card payments. Built during the Tata iQ x Forage simulation, it aims to support the Collections team with early risk identification.

---

##  Problem Statement
Identify risky credit card customers using financial behavior and help collections team prioritize outreach.

---

##  Approach
- **EDA**: Analyzed distributions, patterns, and class imbalance
- **Feature Engineering**: Encoded categories, created average payment score
- **Modeling**: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost
- **Imbalance Handling**: SMOTE for class balancing
- **Evaluation**: Accuracy, ROC AUC, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report
- **Visualization**: PCA, feature importance, payment behavior trends

---

##  Key Results
- **Random Forest**: 90.4% Accuracy, 0.90 AUC
- **XGBoost**: 89.2% Accuracy, 0.89 AUC
- **Logistic Regression**: 51.7% Accuracy (poor performance due to class imbalance)

##  Tools & Libraries
- Python, Jupyter Notebook
- pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- imbalanced-learn (SMOTE)
- XGBoost
